Dear students,

this is the GitLab-Project for the lab of OOAD. It contains code, that you will need for the exercises of the lab.

You have to commit your preparation and your follow-up of the exercises into this project. 
Based on those results you will get the attestation for the lab.

Be proud of your software!

Ralf Hahn
