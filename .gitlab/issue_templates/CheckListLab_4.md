# Expected Results for Class Diagram "Navigation using Inheritance" (*_Navigation_Inheritance_CD.pdf*) 
- [ ] Class Navigation is abstract and contains 3 methods; *calculateRoute()* is abstract
- [ ] inheritance relationships to 3 sub-classes (NaviFast, Navi...)
- [ ] sub-classes implement 'calculateRoute()'
- [ ] Diagram complete and follows UML standard

# Expected Results for Class Diagram "Navigation using Strategy Pattern with 2 Strategies" (*_Navigation_Strategy_CD.pdf*)
- [ ] Class Navigation is *not* abstract anymore and contains 3 methods (but not calculateRoute anymore)
- [ ] Constructor of Navigation expects NavStrategy and DisplayStrategy
- [ ] Class Navigation has a NavStrategy and and DisplayStrategy (aggregation) and two setters
- [ ] Interface NavStrategy declares abstract method *calculateRoute*
- [ ] Implements-relationships to 3 sub-classes (NaviFast, Navi...)
- [ ] Sub-classes implement 'calculateRoute()'
- [ ] Interface DisplayStrategy declares abstract method *display*
- [ ] Implements-relationships to 2 sub-classes (2D, 3D)
- [ ] Sub-classes implement 'display()'
- [ ] Diagram complete and follows UML standard

# Code of Lab4
- [ ] Results published in time? 
- [ ] Code working and fulfills requirements?

- [ ] Both setters of Navigation implemented
- [ ] DisplayStrategy implemented? (New Interface)
- [ ] main-File creates and switches strategy objects?
